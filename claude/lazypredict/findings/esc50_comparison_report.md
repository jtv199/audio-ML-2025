## Analysis

### Why Performance Differs

**Factors Favoring ESC-50:**
1. **Balanced dataset** - All classes have exactly 40 samples
2. **Larger classes** - 40 samples per class vs variable (1-75) in FreeSound
3. **Curated categories** - Well-defined, distinct sound categories
4. **Controlled recording** - More consistent audio quality

**Factors Favoring FreeSound:**
1. **More training data** - 3,414 samples vs 1,600 in ESC-50
2. **Filtered to strong classes** - Only using single-label samples
3. **Domain-specific** - May have more acoustic variety

### Class Imbalance Impact

- **ESC-50**: Perfectly balanced (40 samples per class)
  - No class imbalance issues
  - All classes get equal representation

- **FreeSound**: Highly imbalanced
  - Some classes have only 1-4 test samples (0% accuracy)
  - Top classes have 15+ samples (90-100% accuracy)
  - 30% of classes have <5 samples

7. **Siren** - 0% (0/8 correct)
8. **Vacuum_cleaner** - 0% (0/8 correct)

### Comparison with FreeSound

**FreeSound Top 5:**
1. Finger_snapping - 100% (15/15 correct)
2. Trickle_and_dribble - 100% (7/7 correct)
3. Glockenspiel - 93.9% (10/11 correct)
4. Hi-hat - 92.9% (13/14 correct)
5. Bicycle_bell - 92.3% (12/13 correct)

**FreeSound Bottom 5:**
1. Acoustic_guitar - 0% (0/1 correct - 1 sample)
2. Crowd - 0% (0/1 correct - 1 sample)
3. Drip - 0% (0/1 correct - 1 sample)
4. Squeak - 0% (0/4 correct - 4 samples)
5. Cutlery_and_silverware - 0% (0/7 correct - 7 samples)

**Key Difference:** FreeSound's 0% classes have insufficient data (1-7 samples). ESC-50's 0% classes have adequate samples (8 each) but are inherently difficult to classify with these features.

## Key Insights

### 1. Dataset Quality Matters

- **Balanced datasets** (ESC-50) eliminate class imbalance issues
- **Sample size** is critical - classes with <10 samples fail consistently

### 2. Feature Effectiveness

- STFT + MEL + CQT features achieve **moderate performance** on both datasets
- Features capture enough information for ~50-60% accuracy ceiling
- Similar feature extraction yields comparable results across datasets

### 3. Transferability

- Same features work across different audio domains
- Performance depends more on dataset quality than domain
- Linear models (SVC) are robust across datasets

---

## Conclusions

1. **FreeSound significantly outperforms ESC-50** (56.6% vs 35.0%)
   - More training data (3,414 vs 1,600 samples) is critical
   - Domain matters: FreeSound's curated single-label samples may be easier

2. **Class imbalance is NOT the main issue**
   - ESC-50 is perfectly balanced (40 samples per class)
   - Yet 8 classes still achieve 0% accuracy with 8 test samples each
   - **Feature quality matters more than balance**

3. **STFT+MEL+CQT features have limitations**
   - 35% accuracy on ESC-50 is modest at best
   - Many environmental sounds (sirens, helicopters, clocks) not captured well
   - These features better suited for music/distinct sounds vs general audio

4. **Sample size matters, but isn't everything**
   - ESC-50 has consistent 8 samples per class in test
   - 8 classes with 0% show features fail, not data quantity
   - FreeSound's 0% classes genuinely lack data (1-7 samples)

5. **Dataset quality > Dataset balance**
   - FreeSound's imbalanced but larger dataset wins
   - More diverse training data (3,414 samples) beats perfect balance (1,600)

## Recommendations

### For ESC-50
- **URGENT: Switch to deep learning**
  - 35% accuracy too low for practical use
  - CNN on mel-spectrograms likely to reach 60-70%
  - Pre-trained models (VGGish, PANNs) could exceed 80%

- Try temporal features
  - Add delta and delta-delta MFCCs
  - Include zero-crossing rate, spectral rolloff
  - Capture time-series patterns (RNNs/LSTMs)

### For FreeSound
- **FreeSound is already performing well** (56.6%)
  - Fix class imbalance to push to 65-70%
  - Add more data for rare classes
  - Otherwise, tabular features working well

### General Insights
- **More data > Better balance** (shown by results)
- **Feature choice is critical** - STFT/MEL/CQT insufficient for general environmental sounds
- **Deep learning is necessary** for ESC-50 to be competitive
- **Domain matters** - music/distinct sounds easier than general environmental audio
