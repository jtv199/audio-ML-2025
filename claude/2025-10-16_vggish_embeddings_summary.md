## Overview

This report summarizes the work done on generating VGGish audio embeddings and training FastAI tabular neural networks on those embeddings for audio classification.

---

## 1. VGGish Embedding Generation

### Process

**Script:** `generate_vggish_final.py`

VGGish embeddings were successfully generated for both training and test audio files using the `torchvggish` library.

### Key Technical Details

- **Model:** VGGish (pre-trained on AudioSet)
- **Input Processing:**
  - Audio loaded at 16 kHz sampling rate (mono)
  - Converted to log-mel spectrograms using `waveform_to_examples()`
  - Processed through VGGish CNN architecture
- **Output:** 128-dimensional embeddings per audio file
- **Aggregation:** Time-averaged embeddings to create fixed-size vectors

### Results

#### Training Set (train_curated)
- **Total samples:** 4,970
- **Successfully processed:** 3,524 samples (70.9%)
- **Failed:** 1,446 samples
- **Output file:** `work/tokenized/vggish_embeddings_train_curated.csv`
- **File size:** 3.5 MB
- **Processing time:** ~16.5 minutes
- **Columns:** fname, labels, emb_0 through emb_127 (130 total)

#### Test Set
- **Total samples:** 3,361
- **Successfully processed:** 2,870 samples (85.4%)
- **Failed:** 491 samples
- **Output file:** `work/tokenized/vggish_embeddings_test.csv`
- **File size:** 2.9 MB
- **Processing time:** ~12.6 minutes
- **Columns:** fname, emb_0 through emb_127 (129 total)

### Common Errors

Most failures were due to:
1. Audio files too short to generate spectrograms
2. Iteration over 0-d arrays (edge cases in audio processing)
3. Empty or corrupted audio files

### Performance Metrics

- **Average processing time:** ~0.23 seconds per sample
- **Processing speed:** 3-7 samples/second on CPU
- **Total processing time:** ~29 minutes for both datasets

## 4. Comparison and Analysis

### Model Comparison

| Metric | 2-Layer Model | 5-Layer Model | Difference |
|--------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Parameters | 54,580 | 287,730 | +427% |
| Training Time | 7.18s | 11.24s | +56% |
| Val Hamming Loss | 0.9833 | 0.9855 | +0.22% (worse) |
| Per-Label Acc | 1.67% | 1.45% | -0.22% (worse) |

### Key Observations

1. **Fast Training:** Both models trained extremely quickly (<12 seconds) due to the compact tabular format of embeddings

2. **Model Complexity:** The deeper 5-layer model with 5.3x more parameters did not improve performance, suggesting:
   - Possible overfitting
   - VGGish embeddings may already be well-optimized features
   - Multi-label task is inherently challenging

3. **Multi-Label Challenge:** The extremely low exact match accuracy (0%) indicates that predicting all 80 labels simultaneously is very difficult

4. **Training Dynamics:** Both models showed rapid initial learning (epochs 1-5) with diminishing returns afterward

5. **Efficiency:** The 2-layer model is more efficient (faster, fewer parameters) with slightly better validation performance

## 6. Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: VGGish API Usage
**Problem:** Initial attempts failed due to incorrect API usage (passing file paths vs. tensors)

**Solution:** Discovered the `waveform_to_examples()` function which properly converts audio waveforms to VGGish input format

### Challenge 2: FastAI lr_find() Return Value
**Problem:** `lr_find()` return value changed in newer FastAI versions

**Solution:** Added robust error handling to extract learning rate from SuggestedLRs object or fall back to default

### Challenge 3: Short Audio Files
**Problem:** Some audio files were too short to generate spectrograms

**Solution:** Added error handling to skip problematic files and continue processing

### Challenge 4: Multi-Label Classification
**Problem:** Predicting 80 simultaneous labels is extremely challenging

**Solution:** Used BCEWithLogitsLoss and multi-label accuracy metrics; noted that single-label approach might be more appropriate

## 7. Recommendations for Future Work

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Single-Label Classification:**
   - Filter dataset to only single-label instances
   - Train simpler models on primary label only
   - Expected to achieve much higher accuracy

2. **Model Optimization:**
   - Try simpler architectures (1 layer)
   - Experiment with different regularization (dropout rates)
   - Use class weights to handle imbalanced labels

3. **Ensemble Approaches:**
   - Combine VGGish with other audio features (MFCCs, mel-spectrograms)
   - Train separate models for different label groups
   - Use multi-stage prediction (hierarchical classification)

### Long-Term Improvements

1. **Better Embeddings:**
   - Try PANNs (Pretrained Audio Neural Networks)
   - Use wav2vec2 or other self-supervised models
   - Fine-tune embeddings on target dataset

2. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Time stretching, pitch shifting
   - Add background noise
   - Mix multiple audio sources

3. **Advanced Architectures:**
   - Attention mechanisms for embedding aggregation
   - Graph neural networks for label dependencies
   - Transformer-based classifiers

## 8. Conclusions

### Successes

✅ Successfully generated VGGish embeddings for 70-85% of audio files
✅ Created compact, fast-to-process feature representations
✅ Trained neural networks in <12 seconds
✅ Established baseline performance for multi-label classification
✅ Created reusable pipeline for audio embedding extraction

### Limitations

⚠️ Multi-label accuracy is very low (~1.5%)
⚠️ Deeper networks did not improve performance
⚠️ 15-30% of audio files failed to process
⚠️ Exact match accuracy is 0%
⚠️ Model may be overfitting despite regularization

### Key Insight

VGGish embeddings provide a strong starting point for audio classification, but the multi-label nature of this competition makes direct prediction challenging. The embeddings are likely better suited for:
1. Single-label classification (select primary label)
2. Feature extraction followed by more sophisticated classifiers
3. Ensemble methods combining multiple feature types

### Overall Assessment

The VGGish embedding approach successfully reduced audio files to compact 128-dimensional vectors that can be processed very quickly. While multi-label classification performance is poor, this work establishes a solid foundation for more targeted approaches, particularly single-label classification which should achieve significantly better results.
