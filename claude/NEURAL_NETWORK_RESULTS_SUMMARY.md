## FreeSound Dataset Results ✗

### Dataset Information
- **Total samples**: 4,970
- **Single-class samples**: 4,269 (85.9%)
- **Train samples**: 3,415 (80%)
- **Valid samples**: 854 (20%)
- **Classes**: 74 (imbalanced)
- **Features**: 2,474 (STFT + MEL + CQT)

### Model Performance

| Model | Architecture | Accuracy | Balanced Accuracy | F1 Score | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| **LinearSVC** | - | **56.60%** | - | - | ✓ Baseline |
| **2-Layer NN** | [200, 100] | **1.06%** | 1.37% | 0.0002 | ✗ **FAILED** |

### Issue Analysis - FreeSound

**Problem**: Training completely failed with NaN losses and 1.06% accuracy

**Root Cause**: Numerical instability due to unnormalized features

**Evidence**:
- Loss values: `nan` (Not a Number) from epoch 1
- Accuracy stuck at ~1% (random guessing with 74 classes would be 1.35%)
- Same feature extraction worked fine on ESC-50

**Why ESC-50 worked but FreeSound didn't**:
1. **Dataset size**: FreeSound has 2x more samples (3,415 vs 1,600)
2. **Class imbalance**: FreeSound is imbalanced (74 classes), ESC-50 is balanced (50 classes)
3. **Feature scaling**: FastAI's TabularDataLoaders may handle small/balanced datasets better
4. **Feature distribution**: FreeSound features may have different scale/distribution

**Solution Required**:
- Add feature normalization/standardization before training
- Use `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` from sklearn
- Alternative: Use FastAI's `Normalize` transform in the TabularPandas object

## Next Steps / Recommendations

### To Fix FreeSound Neural Network Training

1. **Add feature normalization**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   scaler = StandardScaler()
   X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
   X_valid_scaled = scaler.transform(X_valid)
   ```

2. **Alternative: Use FastAI's built-in normalization**:
   ```python
   procs = [Normalize]
   dls = TabularDataLoaders.from_df(..., procs=procs)
   ```

3. **Try different learning rates**:
   - Current: 1e-3
   - Try: 1e-4, 5e-4 (more conservative)
   - Use `learn.lr_find()` to find optimal learning rate

4. **Adjust batch size**:
   - Current: 64
   - Try: 32 or 128 to see if it affects stability

5. **Use gradient clipping**:
   ```python
   learn.fit_one_cycle(epochs, lr, cbs=GradientClip(1.0))
   ```

### To Improve ESC-50 Neural Network Results

1. **Try different architectures**:
   - Current best: [200, 100] (52.75%)
   - Try: [400, 200], [300, 150, 75], [500]

2. **Experiment with learning rates**:
   - Use `learn.lr_find()` to find optimal LR
   - Current: 1e-3 might not be optimal

3. **Add dropout for regularization**:
   ```python
   learn = tabular_learner(dls, layers=[200, 100], ps=[0.5, 0.25])
   ```

4. **Train for more epochs**:
   - Current: 10 epochs
   - Try: 20, 30 epochs with early stopping

5. **Ensemble models**:
   - Combine 2-layer NN (52.75%) with LinearSVC (35%)
   - Could achieve > 55% accuracy

## Conclusions

1. **ESC-50**: Neural networks (52.75%) significantly outperform LinearSVC (35%)
   - Best architecture: 2-layer [200, 100]
   - Shallow networks work better with limited data

2. **FreeSound**: Neural network training failed due to lack of feature normalization
   - LinearSVC (56.6%) remains the best model
   - Requires feature scaling to train neural networks successfully

3. **General insights**:
   - Simpler models (LinearSVC) are more robust to unnormalized features
   - Neural networks require careful preprocessing
   - More data helps LinearSVC more than raw neural networks
   - Dataset balance matters less than proper feature scaling

4. **Winner for production**:
   - **ESC-50**: 2-layer Neural Network (52.75%)
   - **FreeSound**: LinearSVC (56.60%) - until NN is fixed with normalization
