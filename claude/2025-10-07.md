## Session Summary

### Previous Work
Last session focused on adapting a Kaggle audio classification notebook for local execution:
- Changed data paths from `../input` to `./input`
- Added conditional environment detection to handle Kaggle vs local environments
- Modified working directory setup

### Issues Encountered
1. Missing `librosa` library (ModuleNotFoundError at cell-6)
2. Missing test audio files at expected path `/kaggle/input/test/`

### Current State
- Repository: free-sound-audio-tagging-2019
- Branch: master
- Modified files: `cnn-2d-basic-solution-powered-by-fast-ai.ipynb`
- Untracked: `freesound_env/` directory
- Last commit: "haven't worked out the path"

### Next Steps
- Install required dependencies (librosa, fastai, etc.)
- Verify data file locations
- Complete path configuration for local environment
