## Validation Strategy

All models use the **same validation strategy** for fair comparison:

- **Split**: 80% training / 20% validation
- **Method**: `train_test_split` with `random_state=42`
- **Stratification**: Yes - maintains class distribution
- **Holdout**: Validation set completely unseen during training
- **Single evaluation**: No cross-validation (faster, but less robust)

This ensures:
✅ No data leakage
✅ Unbiased comparison
✅ Fair accuracy estimates
✅ Reproducible results
